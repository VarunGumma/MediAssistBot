Provisional figures

* Added to the list of notifiable diseases as of 30 Jun 2022. To date, all mpox infections detected have been Clade IIb infections.

^ With effect from E-week 27, 2023, only confirmed cases of MERS will be reported, instead of the number of persons tested.
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Situation in Singapore 2025

ARI indicators for E-week 28 (6 - 12 Jul 2025) were as follows:
The average daily number of patients seeking treatment in the polyclinics for ARI was 2148 (over 5.5 working days) in E-week 28.

In E-week 28, the top respiratory pathogens among adult and paediatric samples from the National Surveillance Programme for Acute Respiratory Infection§ (ARI) were:

• Adult samples: Human rhinovirus/enterovirus (22%), SARS-CoV-2 (18%), and Influenza (4%).
• Paediatric samples: Human rhinovirus/enterovirus (30%), Parainfluenza viruses (11%), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (10%).

§ CDA monitors the trends of respiratory pathogens in the community through our sentinel surveillance programme for Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) which includes polyclinics and selected general practitioner (GP) clinics.
COVID-19 and Influenza

The proportion of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) among the polyclinic attendances for ARI was 0.3%.

The positivity rate for influenza among ILI samples (n= 105) in the community was 9% in E-week 28. The positivity rate for COVID-19 among ARI samples (n= 246) in the community was 16% in E-week 28.

Of the 82 specimens tested positive for influenza in June 2025, 27 were positive for Influenza A(pH1N1) (33%), 45 were positive for Influenza A(H3N2) (55%), and 10 were positive for Influenza B (12%).

Based on influenza-like illness (ILI) samples from GPs and polyclinics
The number of dengue notifications was 112 in E-week 28. The number of hospital admissions decreased to 9 in E-week 28, compared to 12 in E-week 27. Preliminary results of all positive dengue samples serotyped in June 2025 showed DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4 at 5.8%, 75.8%, 12.6% and 5.8% respectively.
