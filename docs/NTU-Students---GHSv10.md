of the policyholder or insured, no premiums paid will be returned. If any claim has been admitted and benefits paid before AIA was made aware of the misstatement, the Policyholder will on demand by AIA reimburse AIA all benefits paid or the monetary equivalent of such benefits (as may be reasonably determined by us) if they were not paid in cash.
