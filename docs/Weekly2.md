* Provisional figures
* Added to the list of notifiable diseases as of 30 Jun 2022. To date, all mpox infections detected have been Clade IIb infections.
* With effect from E-week 27, 2023, only confirmed cases of MERS will be reported, instead of the number of persons tested.
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Situation in Singapore 2025

ARI indicators for E-week 33 (10 - 16 Aug 2025) were as follows:
The average daily number of patients seeking treatment in the polyclinics for ARI was 2353 (over 5.5 working days) in E-week 33.

In E-week 33, the top respiratory pathogens among adult and paediatric samples from the National Surveillance Programme for Acute Respiratory Infection§ (ARI) were:

• Adult samples: Human rhinovirus/enterovirus (24%), Influenza (11%), and SARS-CoV-2 (6%).
• Paediatric samples: Human rhinovirus/enterovirus (38%), Influenza (11%), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (8%).

§ CDA monitors the trends of respiratory pathogens in the community through our sentinel surveillance programme for Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) which includes polyclinics and selected general practitioner (GP) clinics.
COVID-19 and Influenza

The proportion of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) among the polyclinic attendances for ARI was 0.5%.

The positivity rate for influenza among ILI samples (n= 127) in the community was 20% in E-week 33. The positivity rate for COVID-19 among ARI samples (n= 289) in the community was 6% in E-week 33.

Of the 74 specimens tested positive for influenza in July 2025, 29 were positive for Influenza A(pH1N1) (39%), 36 were positive for Influenza A(H3N2) (49%), and 9 were positive for Influenza B (12%).

Based on influenza-like illness (ILI) samples from GPs and polyclinics
The number of dengue notifications was 62 in E-week 33. The number of hospital admissions decreased to 11 in E-week 33, compared to 12 in E-week 32. Preliminary results of all positive dengue samples serotyped in August 2025 showed DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4 at 3.6%, 67.9%, 25.0% and 3.6% respectively.
