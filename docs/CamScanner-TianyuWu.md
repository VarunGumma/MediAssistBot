Are your kidneys OK?

2 tests to check your kidney health:

**Blood Test**
Detects serum creatinine, which is a breakdown of creatine found in muscles and is filtered by the kidneys into the urine. A formula is then used to calculate our kidney function.

**Urine Test**
Detects albumin, which is a type of protein in our blood. Abnormal protein level in urine may be a sign of kidney damage.
