Places to go for HIV testing

Getting tested for HIV is the only way to know your HIV status. Early detection allows you to seek treatment and delay the onset of AIDS and further complications. With early and effective treatment, people living with HIV can lead lives no different from others.

You can get yourself tested for STIs or HIV/AIDS at most GP (General Practitioner) clinics, polyclinics, and hospitals in Singapore. Most clinics offer routine HIV screening services, while some also offer rapid HIV testing. Anonymous tests are also available if you do not wish to provide any personal information.

All test results are kept strictly confidential.

Rapid HIV Testing

There are GP clinics which offer rapid HIV testing. The test takes about 20 minutes. Please do call the clinic of your choice before you go, to confirm that the clinic is currently offering rapid HIV testing. To learn which clinics offer rapid test services, click here.
