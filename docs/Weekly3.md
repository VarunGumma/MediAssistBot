* Provisional figures
^ Added to the list of notifiable diseases as of 30 Jun 2022. To date, all mpox infections detected have been Clade IIb infections.
^ With effect from E-week 27, 2023, only confirmed cases of MERS will be reported, instead of the number of persons tested.
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Situation in Singapore 2025

ARI indicators for E-week 37 (7 - 13 Sep 2025) were as follows:
The average daily number of patients seeking treatment in the polyclinics for ARI was 2498 (over 5.5 working days) in E-week 37.

In E-week 37, the top respiratory pathogens among adult and paediatric samples from the National Surveillance Programme for Acute Respiratory Infection§ (ARI) were:

- Adult samples: Human rhinovirus/enterovirus (23%), influenza (22%), and RSV (8%).
- Paediatric samples: Human rhinovirus/enterovirus (32%), influenza (24%), and RSV (9%).

§ CDA monitors the trends of respiratory pathogens in the community through our sentinel surveillance programme for Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) which includes polyclinics and selected general practitioner (GP) clinics.
COVID-19 and Influenza

The proportion of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) among the polyclinic attendances for ARI was 0.7%. The positivity rate for influenza among ILI samples (n= 172) in the community was 38% in E-week 37. The positivity rate for COVID-19 among ARI samples (n= 321) in the community was 3% in E-week 37.

Of the 119 specimens tested positive for influenza in August 2025, 25 were positive for Influenza A(pH1N1) (21%), 84 were positive for Influenza A(H3N2) (71%), and 10 were positive for Influenza B (8%).

Based on influenza-like illness (ILI) samples from GPs and polyclinics
The number of dengue notifications was 50 in E-week 37. The number of hospital admissions increased to 4 in E-week 37, compared to 3 in E-week 36. Preliminary results of all positive dengue samples serotyped in August 2025 showed DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4 at 8.0%, 66.7%, 24.1% and 1.1% respectively.
